- 👀 I’m interested in hiking, travelling, photography, nature, biology, art, teaching and coding of course.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, more specifically html basics, css, JavaScript, Angular, React, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative beginner to intermediate level web development projects. I enjoy both backend and frontend so far.
